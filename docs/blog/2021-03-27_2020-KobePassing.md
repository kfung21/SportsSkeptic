## *Overview*
2020 was like no other year in history. Never has a global pandemic like covid-19 taken the world by storm and forced everyone to remain at home. Additionally, the passing of Kobe Bryant marked the passing of a iconic legend, which became a theme of tragic deaths in the wake of covid-19. The black lives matter movement reached an all time high with the George Floyd Protests. Along the theme of tense racial relations was the increased violence towards the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. At the end of the year, President Trump was voted out and Biden/Kamala took over.

## Kobe Bryant's Death (Jan 2020)
Few deaths in history seemed as poignant as the passing of Kobe Bryant on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant#Death">Jan 26, 2020</a>. It felt like the world came to a standstill with basketball games being postponed and players sitting out. The closest thing in recent history to this would be the passing of the beloved Princess Diana in the 90s. 

Kobe Bryant was a generational talent who's best remembered for chasing Michael Jordan in rings and establishing the no-nonsense approach to basketball, which he coined "Mamba Mentality". Shortly after his retirement, he won an Oscar for his short animated film "Dear Basketball", which encapsulated his relationship with the sport he spent his entire life training and dedicated to moving forward. 

Along with his daughter Gianna and her other teammates and parents, they were all in the Helicopter that crashed down near Calabasas, CA.  It was a cloudy, windy day an ominous day that won't be forgotten anytime soon.
