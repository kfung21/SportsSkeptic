Matt Chapman Begs A's Fans to Come to the Park

Note: This is a continuation of my first background post on the downfall of [live sports entertainment](http://sportsskeptic.com/blog/2019-10-10_OaklandA'sTheDeathofBaseballandSportsEntertainment-Part1(Don%E2%80%99tBlametheMillennials).html) going forward. Here, I will address my gripes with A’s Access.

## Good in Theory

What works well in theory and in the classroom is a subscription or membership model. In practice, this is very difficult to implement successfully. The general premise is that for a low recurring cost, a person may receive numerous benefits otherwise not afforded to them. Costco is famous for pioneering the membership business model, yet remains limited in profitability. The price needs to be competitive for a person to choose to subscribe yet be high enough such that the business can be profitable. I would argue that A’s Access does not achieve this and there may not be a price point to make this a sustainable business model.

## Subscriptions all the rave now, but too many, cheaper competing options exist 

Like it or not, A’s Access is now competing with consumers’ other recurring costs: internet, water, electricity, Gym, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Costco etc. These are much cheaper options and yield arguably much greater benefits. The benefit to cost ratio is arguably much greater for these services than A’s Access is for the general public. What consumers see is that A’s Access is pre-charging them a $300 fee upfront that they must use enough times in a year to get a return on investment. Simply put, I need to eat $300 worth of food in order to get my money back. Chris Giles may argue this vehemently, but that won’t change most people’s perception of A’s Access. Why should I pre-pay for food, when I can bring food into the coliseum for free? It’s a no brainer that to get the best experience for the lowest cost, I should just go to stubhub for a single game and then bring my own food.

## Non-transferrable to share with family/friends

If there was a way to share A’s Access easily like how Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Costco are shared then it would be more appealing. It may not be fair to compare A’s Access to digital subscriptions like Amazon Prime and Netflix, but part of the appeal of those is that they can be shared with family or friends without too much trouble. A Costco membership has the same problems of sharing with family and friends in that you need the person with the membership card to be physically present to use it. A trip to Costco, however, usually entails multiple people dumping bulk items into a single shopping cart and checking out together. The same cannot be said about attending a baseball game or making the final food transaction. Usually people will go to the concession lines when they are hungry and want food not all at once together especially when so many food options exist. If somehow the Coliseum were to turn into a giant cafeteria then this could work, but with so many different vendors and checkout lines this is impossible.

## Still need to pay for a ticket

One of the biggest hurdles the A’s faced when rolling out A’s Access was educating the public that becoming a member is not the same as a ticket to a game. While an A’s Access member can go to every game, without a ticket they are only allowed in certain areas namely the Treehouse. Tickets to A’s games regularly fall below $20 on stubhub for value deck seats with a $6 food voucher included. When most items at the coliseum cost between $7-$15, $6 is already almost half off in most cases making the 50% concessions a moot point. A ticket is still required to have a seat at the coliseum to watch the game. Most people only go to a handful of games a year and the thought of hanging out only at the Treehouse or Shibe Tavern and not sitting watching the game doesn’t make much sense. To really get the full experience of a live event you have to have a seat in front of the action otherwise you may as well go to a sports bar or stay home.

## Some vendors can’t get it to work in the system

Have you ever stood in a long concession line and when it’s finally your turn and you show the cashier your phone with A’s Access and Food Voucher, it doesn’t work? Admittedly this is still a new system and with high turnover in concessions employees, many times it just doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. Sometimes it’s the scanner not reading the barcode on your phone, other times it’s the new cashier not knowing which options to select on their register, and sometimes once it’s scanned, nothing shows up on the cashier’s end. I’ve heard too many stories of A’s Access and ticket vouchers failing and rather than hold up the long line of hungry people to debug the issue, we wind up paying full price anyways. It puts a real damper to the game experience. Sure you can always take it up with ticket services, but who wants to wait in that line during the game? The fact that so many things can go wrong makes what was supposed to be a perk and convenience into a hassle that is more trouble than it is worth.

## Possible Changes to A’s Access?

Is there a business model or a price point that A’s Access can be successful? I’d argue that the price should be reduced in order to compete with other subscription entertainment services. Instead the A’s have decided to increase prices, but the product remains the same. If the A’s business side can address all the issues then that would be a start. The A’s have shone the propensity to try different things to increase attendance and attract more fans. Earlier this year the A’s had a single game where tickets were free and successfully filled up the coliseum on a weekday. With a free ticket, most people would be inclined to purchase concessions with the savings. I’m not suggesting that all games be free, but it is the best way to attract more fans, by lowering the cost of entry.
