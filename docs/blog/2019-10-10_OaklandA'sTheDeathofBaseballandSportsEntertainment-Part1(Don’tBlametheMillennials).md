Disclaimer: this is an oped post and all these takes are my own. I am a huge A’s fan, but am cancelling my A’s Access and will try to explain the rationale in [part 2](https://www.athleticsnation.com/2019/10/12/20911228/the-pitfalls-of-a-s-access-business-model-part-2).

## Millennial Dilemma 

As someone who was born in the late 80s and classified as a millennial, we are constantly told we are destroying everything including baseball attendance. This is not entirely true. Today [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/1266088/2019/10/10/how-interested-are-you-right-now-attendance-changing-fandom-and-the-health-of-major-league-baseball/) put out a controversial piece regarding waning fan interest in baseball and sports in general. He makes many good points that I would like to expand upon now and in future posts. If I had to overgeneralize all the reasons why baseball and sports are dying it would be because of high costs, time commitment, and apathy (lack of interest). The latter reason could also fall under time and costs.

## Limited Free Time

Over the course of a day, our time while awake is limited to 16-18 hours. Most of us have mandatory large time commitments: work, school, commuting, errands, homework, and extra-curricular. These are all time and energy sinks, so with the precious remaining time we can allocate for entertainment and fun. Baseball is entertainment and brings joys to the many of us who are fans. With the advent of the internet in the 90s to the expansion of high speed streaming options this decade, people have myriad options for entertainment in 2019 and beyond. It only makes sense for us to use our remaining time and energy on entertainment options that are low energy costs and bring high happiness. With the increasing barriers to baseball and live sports, it is no surprise that the industry is dying.

## Cost of Attending Live Sports

The costs of attending a baseball or sports event have increased substantially. It is not just the ticket price that has gone up and if anything, the A’s are the best value in all of pro sports. However, the costs in gas, transportation, food, and energy (added stress) make going to games unappealing. For a family of four if you spend $20 per ticket, $30 on BART tickets (or $20 on parking and gas), $15 for food per person, this easily adds up to over $100 total just to attend a 2-3 hour game. This is a lot of money that could be used for groceries, pay bills, or a year’s worth of Netflix/Amazon Prime/Costco membership. Which is the best use of limited discretionary spending? Beyond the monetary costs are the added energy costs and stresses that you must deal with. Rather than staying home and watching the game on TV, you must now fight through traffic driving or use BART, navigate through crowds of people on the BART ramp and inside the coliseum, and worry about getting home in a timely manner. To a sports fan these may seem minor, but to the average person is kind of a big deal. Is the experience of attending a game in person worth the headache for a marginally better experience than watching it at home?

## Baseball a Dying Sport

Baseball is a timeless game that is dying all over the world. Baseball is "most popular" in Japan and Latin America. Japan is an industrialized nation and first world country, but there is no baseball being played in Tokyo among kids. Tokyo is the largest metro and you would be hard-pressed to find many baseball diamonds. It is no surprise then that many of the largest stars to come from Japan came from smaller towns: Ichiro (Toyoyama), Ohtani (Oshu), Darvish (Habikino), Matsui (Neagari), Nomo (Osaka, but was much smaller in 1968). As metro areas become denser like Tokyo, fewer kids will play baseball growing up and be less inclined to be interested as adults. As of now, baseball games in Japan cater more towards the business crowd (see beer girls), who are more interested in socializing with clients. While there are some good crowds in the cheaper cheering sections in the outfield (think RF Coliseum bleachers), those are dwindling too as the costs and other entertainment options increase. Soccer is quickly gaining momentum and tennis players like Nishikori and Naomi Osaka have brought increased interest in Tennis to Japan. Now that Ichiro (a God in Japan) has retired, is there anyone who can pick up the slack and keep the Japanese interested long term in MLB? Latin America is generally poorer and picked up baseball through cultural appropriation by USA. The ethics remain questionable for setting up shop in these poorer countries to groom kids into the MLB machine via defecting or teenage international signings. I’m not sure if this is something fans would support if they knew the full story and is a sustainable way of keeping interest up.

# Sports Marketing

Not all is lost though; I believe the solution is in the marketing. Steph Curry is a global icon and we see his face everywhere in the bay area whether it’s on billboards, commercials, or news headlines. People will go to Warriors games to see him (unless they charge an arm and a leg for tickets at Chase Arena). Similarly in other countries like in Asia, idols are huge and draw big crowds wherever they go. We can liken it to the pop cultural phenomenon in the states (Backstreet Boys, Taylor Swift, Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Tom Brady etc). These are all household names and for better or worse are in our everyday lexicon. Even the average non-sports fans have heard of these names. MLB fails in the marketing department and that is no secret. Old icons like Ken Griffey Jr., Barry Bonds, Rickey Henderson, and Ichiro Suzuki are long gone and MLB has not really promoted anyone heavily. Mike Trout is the unequivocal choice to take the throne, but I challenge anyone to ask a non-baseball fan if they know who he is or which team he plays for. My gripe for the A’s is that their commercials used to be top notch, but I have not seen any in a long time. Branding players require that they stay on a team for a while, which is also a challenge for A’s players. It’s the chicken/egg, which is another problem entirely for the A’s.

# Summary

I haven’t touched on many specific examples and will do so in future posts. However, they will all follow these similar themes of lack of time, high costs, and apathy. Much of this has to do with the way the world has changed since the rise of internet. Amazon killed many retail stores using the internet and entertainment consumption in the future will also be much different thanks to the internet.
